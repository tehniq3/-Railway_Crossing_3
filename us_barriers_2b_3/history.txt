// inital changes by MKO
// Nicu FLORICA (niq_ro) changed few lines: http://arduinotehniq.blogspot.com/2022/06/railway-crossing-multi-track-two-way.html
// ver.2 - niq_ro added bidirectional trigger
// ver.2.b.2 - niq_ro removed sounds at opening
// ver.2.b.3 - niq_ro adding fade lights 


#define SERVO_PIN      2  //MKO SERVO_PIN was 3 in JS original sketch. Change to D2
#define LED0_PIN       A0  // 3rd led 
#define LED1_PIN       A1  // blink led 1
#define LED2_PIN       A2  // blink led 2
#define LED3_PIN       5  // fade led 1
#define LED4_PIN       6  // fade led 2
#define SENSOR1_PIN    7  //MKO SENSOR1_PIN was 10 in original sketch. Change to D5 
#define SENSOR2_PIN    8  //MKO SENSOR2_PIN was 11 in original sketch. Change to D8
#define SENSOR3_PIN    9  //niq_ro added 3rd sensor
#define SENSOR4_PIN    10 //niq_ro added 4th sensor

#define speakerPin 11 // Can be either 3 or 11, two PWM outputs connected to Timer 2; using 11 in this sketch
